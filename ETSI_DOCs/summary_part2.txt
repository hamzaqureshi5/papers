The second part of the training from Card Centric covers File Management, specifically focusing on Access Conditions. This section include information regarding reference standards such as ETSI and ISO Standards (TS 102.221 & ISO 7816-4). It also covers PIN Definitions, distinguishing between various types including Universal PIN, Application PIN, and Local PIN, each serving distinct purposes within the system. The Security Architecture aspect is highlighted, emphasizing the use of PIN1 and PIN2 as Level 1 and Level 2 key references respectively for user verification. Additionally, it stipulates that for commands like SELECT and STATUS/GET RESPONSE, the file's security conditions must be met. If the UICC fails to determine the access conditions for a requested file, access shall be denied, and an error status word '6982' will be returned.

Furthermore, the Security Architecture Components section elaborates on security attributes and access rules, wherein access mode (AM) defines the applicable commands, and security conditions (SC) outline the required security procedures like user PIN verification. Types of Security Attributes and Access Conditions are elucidated, explaining the compact, expanded, and referenced formats for conveying access rules and operations. The section also covers Access Condition mapping.

Lastly, the training addresses PIN Related Commands, including Verify PIN, Change PIN, Disable PIN, and Enable PIN. Verify PIN involves comparing PIN verification data with stored reference data, with incorrect attempts leading to a decrement in attempts and eventual blocking of the respective PIN after three consecutive false entries. Change PIN allows users to enter a new PIN after successful verification, subject to the same conditions. The Disable PIN command disables the requirement for PIN verification until the UNBLOCK PIN function is activated, while the Enable PIN command re-enables PIN verification.
