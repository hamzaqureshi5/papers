The second part of the training from Card Centric covers references for ETSI (European Telecomunication Standard Inititute) Standards and information on the APDU Command structure, which is used in smart card technology to select a specific file or application on the card. The command structure includes CLA, INS, P1, P2, Lc, and Le parameters, with specific values for each. The input data for the command includes the File ID, File Path, or DF Name, and the output data for an Elementary File (EF) includes various tags such as File Descriptor, File Identifier, Life Cycle Status, Security Attributes, File Size, Total File Size, and Short File Identifier. File structure along with applications are explained in this part of presentation.

The document also describes two types of Elementary Files: Cyclic File and Transparent File. A Cyclic EF contains a fixed number of records with the same fixed length, where new data overwrites the oldest information when all records are used. The record pointer cycles back to the first record when it reaches the last one. For UPDATE operations, only the previous record is used, while for READING operations, addressing methods include Next, Previous, Current, and Record Number.

On the other hand, a Transparent EF contains a sequence of bytes, with the length of the file body indicated in the header. Reading or updating the file involves referencing a relative address (offset) to specify the start position and the number of bytes to be read or updated. The document emphasizes that the size of a Transparent File can change but is not recommended.

Overall, the document provides a detailed overview of the APDU Command, different types of Elementary Files, their structures, and operations within the context of smart card technology.
